# NeuralNetworks
Repository containing all exercises and solutions developed for the course "Neural Networks" at AUTh. All of them are image classifiers for CIFAR-10.
Contains: 
1. k-NN & Nearest Centroid from scratch
2. MLP solution both from scratch and using Tensorflow
3. SVM compared with an MLP with 1 hidden layer that uses Hinge loss for optimization
4. RBF from scratch
